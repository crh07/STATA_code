# STATA_code
STATA code/snippets (mostly econometrics-related); for reference and use in tutorials.

Most of the examples here come from projects related to healthcare (micro-level) datasets, but can be adopted for use in other projects. Snippets are typically included to serve as syntax reminders.

##Long-term goals for this repo:
1. Categorize these examples
2. Create reproducible datasets rather than making these examples depend on non-public datasets/directories
3. Create a STATA/R/Python tutorial, with examples of how to perform similar functions/activities in each language
